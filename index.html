    <h1> WEB DESIGNER<span class="date">March 2013 - Present</span> </h1>
    <br>
    <p>Podcasting operational change management inside of workflows to establish a framework.

    <h1>WEB DESIGN INTERN <span class="date">December 2011 - March 2013</span></h1>
    <p>In a web developer internship, I work with professional developers, designers, and project managers to support
      the development of a website and learn the skills of the trade.

      In simple terms, a website designer makes a site look good. They use design programs to create visual elements.
      Website designers usually have expertise in UI, or user interface, which means they strategically design a site
      that's intuitive and easy for visitors to navigate.29-</p>

    <P> I am very motivational trainer .I trained many students in smart city high school. People learn in different
      ways and at different speeds. When training others, it is essential that you are patient and inclusive.
      I aim to cultivate myconfidence in various domains.Overall, being an IT trainer is about inspiring
      curiosity,promoting problem-soling skills,and preparing individuals for success in the digital age.</P>


    <h1>COMPUTER TEACHER <span class="date">July 2010 - December 2011</span></h1>

    <P>
      I was computer teacher in house of education school.I love this job because The job of a teacher is extremely
      rewarding since it gives the opportunity of becoming part of a person's life and imprint in his mind the knowledge
      that will allow him achieve greater goals. It is a two-way process in which both, teacher and students, have the
      opportunity to learn from each other.</P>

    <!-- My INTEREST -->

    <h1 class=" heading" id="heading5">INTEREST</h1>
    <p>Interest make life interesting! Everyone needs a fun way to spend time outside of work or school. Our hobbies
      give
      us joy and pleasure; they're the activities we never get tired of doing. These pastimes provide us with relaxation
      and leisure, and they also allow us to learn new skills and spend our time productively.

    </p>
    <h1>My Personal Favorite Hobbies</h1>
    <p>There are many hobbies, like drawing, painting, gardening, stamp collecting, photography, reading, sewing,
      crafts, embroidery, knitting, cooking, pet care, coin collecting and so much more. Personally, my favorite hobbies
      are gardening, reading, photography and traveling.

    </p>
    <p>When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring
      chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web
      development world.</p>
